Usage: Moodle administrator
===========================

Since Moodle 2.x supports the `IMS LTI 1.1.1 standard <http://www.imsglobal.org/LTI/>`_
you just need to add an external tool:

Here, you can add a Lab Manager installation, you will need a
**consumer key** and a **shared secret** from the Lab Manager administrator.
Fill in the form and save the external tool.

.. note::

  You could add as many different Lab Manager installations as you
  want as long as you have the consumer and secret keys. This will allow you to
  access different laboratories on different universities each of them with a
  different Lab Manager installation.
